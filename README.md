# Plane App Testing

## About

This is a project where I used open-source app 'Plane' to practice testing. Plane is a software development tool to manage issues, sprints, and product roadmaps (Jira alternative).

My goals are

- get better at manual testing and various types of test automation
- practice other aspects of QA/testing such as test planing and strategy, risk analysis
- learn about app structure, tech stack, deployment
- possibly contribute to the original project with my tests
- get feedback from more experienced people

This is ongoing project. I continue adding new chapters, tests and docs.
