#### Help me to find an issue in my tests in dashboard.spec.ts. When I run command `npx playwright test dashboard.spec.ts --project=chrome ` without using `test.only`. All tests are executed and passed. When I use `test.only` in dashboard.spec.ts I get error `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_hasTests')`  

To troubleshoot the issue with the `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_hasTests')` error when using `test.only` in your `dashboard.spec.ts` file, we need to examine the code and identify any potential issues.

Please provide the content of your `dashboard.spec.ts` file so that we can analyze it and suggest any necessary changes.


#### import { test } from "@playwright/test";  
#### import { DashboardPage } from '../pages/dashboard-page';  
#### import { STORAGE_STATE } from "../../../playwright.config";  
####   
#### let dashboardPage: DashboardPage  
####   
#### test.use({ storageState: STORAGE_STATE });  
####   
#### test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {  
####   dashboardPage = new DashboardPage(page);  
####   await dashboardPage.goto();  
#### });  
####   
####   
#### test.describe("Dashboard page", () => {  
####   
####   test.only("user can open dashboard page", async () => {  
####     await dashboardPage.checkHeading();  
####   });  
####   
####   test("dashboard page visual check", async () => {  
####     await dashboardPage.checkDashboardPageVisual();  
####   });  
####   
#### });  

Thank you for providing the code. 

The issue seems to be related to the use of `test.only` in your `dashboard.spec.ts` file. The error message suggests that the `_hasTests` property is undefined when using `test.only`.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Remove the `test.only` from your test case and run the tests again to see if the error persists. This will help determine if the issue is specific to using `test.only`.

2. If the error still occurs without using `test.only`, there might be an issue with the `DashboardPage` or the `goto` method. Make sure that the `DashboardPage` class is correctly implemented and that the `goto` method is working as expected.

3. If the error only occurs when using `test.only`, it could be a compatibility issue with the version of Playwright or the test runner you are using. Try updating Playwright and the test runner to the latest versions and see if the issue is resolved.

If none of the above steps resolve the issue, please provide more information about your test environment, including the versions of Playwright and the test runner you are using, as well as any relevant error messages or stack traces.
